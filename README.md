# Biometric-Cybersecurity-Research

This project was done as part of a Research Experience for Undergraduates program at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock from June - July 2016.

Our goal was to test the idea of a "pass-thought" (like a password, but with your mind) using a consumer-grade brain computer interface (Emotiv Insight https://www.emotiv.com/#). 

I worked extensively with a co-researcher and PI to construct and carry out our experiment. I also performed digital signal processing in MATLAB to determine that olfactory stimuli were the most effective as a potential "pass-thought".

Here is a link to our final paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7876258
