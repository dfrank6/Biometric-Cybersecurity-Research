# Brain-Computer-Interface-Research
I performed this research project as part of CyberSAFE@UALR Research Experience for Undergraduates program from June - July 2016.

Our goal with this experiment was to test the idea of a "pass-thought" (like a password, but with your mind) using a consumer-grade EEG (Emotiv Insight https://www.emotiv.com/#). 

I worked extensively with a co-researcher as well as a PI to do research, develop and execute an experiment, and perform an analysis on the results.

I wrote the code in MATLAB. We tested different kinds of potential "pass-thought" stimuli such as smell, audio, and movement.

Here is a link to the final paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7876258

This is just a selection of some of the code and results from the experiment.
