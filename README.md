# Biometric-Cybersecurity-Research

This project was done as part of a Research Experience for Undergraduates program at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock from June - July 2016.

I worked with a co-researcher and PI to test the viability of a brainwave biometric user authentication system using a consumer-grade brain computer interface (Emotiv Insight https://www.emotiv.com/#). 

I constructed a filtering and comparison algorithm in MATLAB to process and analyze brainwaves. 

We determined that olfactory stimuli were the most accurate sensory events to serve as mental passwords.

Here is a link to our final paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7876258
